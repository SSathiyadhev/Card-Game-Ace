starts the game by playing any card from their hand to the center of board
* Then other player who is in the left of the first player playes any card from
the same suit
* This continues till all the players played their card in same suit
* Ones completed all the cards in the board go face down to discard pile and
that round is completed
* Player who played the gratest card starts the next turn
* The order of card is A>K>Q>J>10>9.....>2
* During a round if any player does not have the suit which is being played
he can play any card from his hand form any suit if this happens the round
immediately ends and all the cards in the table played in this round goes to the
player who played the gratest card following previously said order
